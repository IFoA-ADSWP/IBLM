\title{Create Density Plot of Corrected Beta values for a Variable}
\usage{
beta_corrected_density(
  varname,
  q = 0.05,
  type = "kde",
  wide_input_frame,
  beta_corrections,
  data,
  iblm_model
)
}
\arguments{
\item{varname}{Character string specifying the variable name OR coefficient name is accepted as well.}

\item{q}{Number, must be between 0 and 0.5. Determines the quantile range of the plot (i.e. value of 0.05 will only show shaps within 5pct --> 95pct quantile range for plot)}

\item{type}{Character string, must be "kde" or "hist"}

\item{wide_input_frame}{Wide format input data frame (one-hot encoded).}

\item{beta_corrections}{Dataframe. This can be output from [beta_corrections_derive]}

\item{data}{Dataframe. The testing data.}

\item{iblm_model}{Object of class 'iblm'}
}
\value{
ggplot object(s) showing the density distribution of corrected beta coefficients
with vertical lines indicating the original coefficient value and standard error bounds.

The item returned will be:
\itemize{
  \item single ggplot object when `varname` was a numerical variable OR a coefficient name
  \item list of ggplot objects when `varname` was a categorical variable
}
}
\description{
Generates a density plot showing the distribution of corrected Beta values
to a GLM coefficient, along with the original Beta coefficient, and standard error bounds around it.
}
\details{
The plot shows:
\itemize{
  \item Density curve of corrected coefficient values
  \item Solid vertical line at the original GLM coefficient
  \item Dashed lines at plus/minus 1 standard error from the coefficient
  \item Automatic x-axis limits that cut off the highest and lowest q pct. If you want axis unaltered, set q = 0
