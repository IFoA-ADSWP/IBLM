\title{Compute Beta Corrections based on SHAP values}
\usage{
beta_corrections_derive(
  shap_wide,
  wide_input_frame,
  iblm_model,
  migrate_reference_to_bias = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shap_wide}{Data frame containing SHAP values from XGBoost that have been converted to wide format by [shap_dim_helper()]}

\item{wide_input_frame}{Wide format input data frame (one-hot encoded).}

\item{iblm_model}{Object of class 'iblm'}

\item{migrate_reference_to_bias}{Logical, do we want to migrate the shap values for reference coefficients to the bias?}
}
\value{
A data frame with beta corrections where:
\itemize{
  \item Categorical variables are properly aggregated by factor level
  \item Continuous variables are normalized by their actual values
  \item Reference level and zero-value corrections are added to the bias term
}
}
\description{
Processes raw SHAP values to create coefficient corrections. The bias is adjusted to account for
zero values in continuous variables and reference levels in categorical variables.
