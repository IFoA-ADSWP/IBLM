\title{Calculate Pinball Scores for Model Comparison}
\usage{
get_pinball_scores(
  res,
  models = c("homog", "GLM", "XGB", "IBLM"),
  target = "ClaimNb",
  return_both = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{Data frame containing model predictions and target variable}

\item{models}{Character vector of model names (column names in res).
Default is c("homog", "GLM", "XGB", "IBLM")}

\item{target}{Character string specifying the target variable column name.
Default is "ClaimNb"}

\item{return_both}{Logical indicating whether to return both Poisson deviance
and pinball scores. Default is FALSE (returns only pinball scores)}
}
\value{
Data frame with model performance metrics. If return_both is TRUE,
  returns both Poisson deviance and pinball scores with a 'stat' column.
  If FALSE, returns only pinball scores as percentages
}
\description{
Computes Poisson deviance and relative pinball scores for multiple models
compared to a homogeneous baseline model.
}
\details{
Pinball scores are calculated as 1 - (model_deviance / homog_deviance),
representing the relative improvement over the homogeneous model.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'results' is a data frame with model predictions
# get_pinball_scores(results, models = c("homog", "GLM"), target = "ClaimNb")
