\title{Create Scatter Plot of Beta Corrections for a Variable}
\usage{
beta_corrected_scatter_deprecated(
  varname,
  q,
  color,
  marginal,
  excl_outliers,
  explain_objects
)
}
\arguments{
\item{varname}{Character. Name of the variable to plot SHAP corrections for.
Must be present in the fitted model.}

\item{q}{Numeric. Quantile threshold for outlier detection (when excl_outliers = TRUE).}

\item{color}{Character or NULL. Name of variable to use for point coloring.
Must be present in the model. Currently not supported for categorical variables.}

\item{marginal}{Logical. Whether to add marginal density plots (numerical variables only).}

\item{excl_outliers}{Logical. Whether to exclude outliers based on quantile method.}

\item{explain_objects}{Named list of objects passed through from \link[IBLMPackage]{explain} function. These are not meant to be populated directly. Items will include: betas, levels_all_cat, wide_input_frame, beta_corrections, data, response_var, predictor_vars_categorical, predictor_vars_continuous, coef_names_reference_cat, custom_colors, chart_theme, coef_names_all, x}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object. For numerical variables: scatter plot with SHAP corrections,
  model coefficient line, and confidence bands. For categorical variables: boxplot
  with coefficient points overlaid.
}
\description{
Generates a scatter plot or boxplot showing SHAP corrections for a specified variable from a fitted model.
For numerical variables, creates a scatter plot with optional coloring and marginal densities. For categorical
variables, creates a boxplot with model coefficients overlaid.
}
\details{
The function handles both numerical and categorical variables differently:
\itemize{
  \item Numerical: Creates scatter plot of variable values vs. beta + SHAP deviations
  \item Categorical: Creates boxplot of SHAP deviations for each level with coefficient overlay
}

For numerical variables, horizontal lines show the model coefficient (solid) and
confidence intervals (dashed). SHAP corrections represent local deviations from
the global model coefficient.
