\title{Generate Global SHAP Correction Distribution Plot}
\usage{
overall_correction(shap, custom_colors, chart_theme)
}
\arguments{
\item{shap}{Data frame containing raw SHAP values including BIAS term.}

\item{custom_colors}{Character vector of hex colors for plot styling.}

\item{chart_theme}{ggplot2 theme object for consistent plot appearance.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing:
\itemize{
  \item Density distribution of exponentiated total SHAP corrections
  \item Vertical reference line at 1.0 (no correction)
  \item Mean correction value in the subtitle
}
}
\description{
Creates a visualization showing the overall distribution of multiplicative
corrections that SHAP values apply to GLM predictions.
}
\details{
This function:
\itemize{
  \item Sums all SHAP values (including bias) for each observation
  \item Exponentiates the totals to show multiplicative corrections
  \item Visualizes how much the XGBoost model corrections deviate from GLM predictions
  \item Values > 1 indicate upward corrections, < 1 indicate downward corrections
}

This global view helps assess the overall magnitude and direction of
model corrections across the entire dataset.
