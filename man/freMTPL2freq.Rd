\title{French Motor Insurance Claims Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 677,991 rows and 10 variables:
\describe{
  \item{ClaimRate}{Number of claims made, at an annualised rate (numeric)}
  \item{VehPower}{Vehicle power rating or engine horsepower category (integer)}
  \item{VehAge}{Age of the vehicle in years (integer)}

  \item{BonusMalus}{Bonus-malus coefficient, a rating factor used in French
    insurance where lower values indicate better driving records (integer)}

\description{
A dataset containing information about French motor insurance policies and claims,
commonly used for actuarial modeling and risk assessment studies.

**IMPORTANT**: This dataset is based on commit "c49cbbb37235fc49616cac8ccac32e1491cdc619" of CASdatasets
There are multiple versions of this dataset circulating online, so be weary when comparing to other versions of `freMTPL2freq`
}
\details{
This dataset is frequently used in actuarial science and insurance analytics
for modeling claim frequency and severity. The ClaimRate variable represents
the response (i.e. number of claims, annualised) while the other variables serve as
potential predictors for risk assessment.

The BonusMalus system is a characteristic feature of French motor insurance,
where coefficients typically range from 50 (best) to over 100 (worst),
reflecting the policyholder's claims history.
