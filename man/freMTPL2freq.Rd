\usage{
freMTPL2freq
}
\description{
This dataset contains automobile insurance policies from France with
exposure and number of claims. It is a benchmark dataset often used for
actuarial modeling of claim frequency (e.g., generalized linear models,
credibility theory, and machine learning applications).
}
\details{
The dataset is a subset of French motor third-party liability (MTPL)
insurance data. It is typically used together with \code{\link{freMTPL2sev}},
which contains claim severity information, to model pure premiums as the
product of frequency and severity.
