\title{Split a data frame into training, validation, and test sets}
\usage{
split_into_train_validate_test(
  df,
  train_prop = 0.7,
  validate_prop = 0.15,
  test_prop = 0.15
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame to be split into subsets.}

\item{train_prop}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the proportion
of data to allocate to the training set.}

\item{validate_prop}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the proportion
of data to allocate to the validation set.}

\item{test_prop}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the proportion
of data to allocate to the test set.}
}
\value{
A named list with three elements:
\describe{
  \item{train}{A data frame containing the training subset}
  \item{validate}{A data frame containing the validation subset}
  \item{test}{A data frame containing the test subset}
}
}
\description{
This function randomly splits a data frame into three subsets for machine
learning workflows: training, validation, and test sets. The proportions
can be customized and must sum to 1.
}
\details{
The function uses random sampling with replacement to assign each
  row to one of the three sets according to the specified proportions. The
  proportions must sum to 1 (with some tolerance for floating point precision).
}
\examples{
# Custom proportions
dfs <- split_into_train_validate_test(
  mtcars,
  train_prop = 0.8,
  validate_prop = 0.1,
  test_prop = 0.1
)

}
