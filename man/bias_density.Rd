\title{Plot density of bias corrections from SHAP values}
\usage{
bias_density(q = 0, type = "hist", shap, data, iblm_model)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{Numeric value between 0 and 0.5 for quantile bounds. A higher number will trim more from the edges
(useful if outliers are distorting your plot window) Default is 0 (i.e. no trimming)}

\item{type}{Character string specifying plot type: "kde" for kernel density or "hist" for histogram. Default is "hist".}

\item{shap}{Data frame containing raw SHAP values.}

\item{data}{Dataframe. The testing data.}

\item{iblm_model}{Object of class 'iblm'}
}
\value{
List with two ggplot objects:
\item{bias_correction_var}{Faceted plot showing bias correction density from each variable.
Note that variables with no records contributing to bias correction are dropped from the plot}
\item{bias_correction_total}{Plot showing total corrected total bias density}
}
\description{
Visualizes the distribution of SHAP corrections that are migrated to bias terms,
showing both per-variable and total bias corrections.
