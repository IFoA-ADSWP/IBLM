\title{Calculate Pinball Scores for IBLM and Additional Models}
\usage{
get_pinball_scores_iblm(
  data,
  iblm_model,
  trim = NA_real_,
  additional_models = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame.
If you have used `split_into_train_validate_test()` this will be the "test" portion of your data.}

\item{iblm_model}{Fitted IBLM model object of class "ens"}

\item{trim}{Numeric trimming parameter for IBLM predictions. Default is `NA_real_`.}

\item{additional_models}{(Named) list of fitted models for comparison. These models MUST be fitted on the same data as `iblm_model` for sensible results.
If unnamed, models are labeled by their class.}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns for "poission_deviance" and "pinball_score" for each model.
}
\description{
Computes Poisson deviance and pinball scores for an IBLM model alongside
homogeneous, GLM, and optional additional models.
}
\details{
Pinball scores are calculated relative to a homogeneous model (i.e. a simple mean prediction of training data).
Higher scores indicate better predictive performance.
