\title{Train XGBoost Model Using the Ensemble Booster Model Parameters}
\usage{
train_xgb_as_per_ens(
  iblm_model,
  xgb_additional_params = list(nrounds = 1000, verbose = 0, early_stopping_rounds = 25)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{iblm_model}{Ensemble model object of class "iblm" containing GLM and
XGBoost model components. Also contains data that was used to train it.}

\item{xgb_additional_params}{Named list of XGBoost parameters. Defaults:
\code{nrounds = 1000}, \code{verbose = 0}, \code{early_stopping_rounds = 25}.}
}
\value{
Trained XGBoost model object (class "xgb.Booster").
}
\description{
Trains an XGBoost model using parameters extracted from the booster residual component of the ensemble model.
This is a convenient way to fit an XGBoost model for comparison with the ensemble.
